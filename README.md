# MERN Stack Web Application with Socket.io

This is a web application built using the MERN stack, which consists of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. The application is also secured using bearer token authentication and utilizes the Socket.io library for real-time communication between the client and server.

## Features

- User authentication with bearer token
- Real-time communication with Socket.io
- MongoDB database for storing application data
- Express.js server for handling HTTP requests
- React front-end for user interface and dynamic rendering
- Node.js runtime environment for server-side JavaScript

## Setup

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install` in the root directory
3. Start the server by running `npm start` in the server directory
4. Start the client by running `npm start` in the client directory

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, you can use it by accessing it through your web browser. The application allows users to perform various tasks such as creating, updating, and deleting data.

Real-time communication is enabled through the use of Socket.io, which allows for instant updates between the client and server. Bearer token authentication is used to secure the application and ensure that only authorized users can access it.
